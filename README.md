# film-explorer-server
This is the server for our film explorer.

## Setup

When you download this, make sure to call `npm install`. This will install express (for easier specification of our routes), body-parser (so we can handle JSON in the messages
), and cors (to handle cross origin setup).


## Running

Call `node app.js`
